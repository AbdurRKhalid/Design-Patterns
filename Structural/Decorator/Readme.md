# Introduction
The Decorator Design Pattern is class of *Structural* and having subclass of *Object Structural*. It helps to add additional functionality to object on the run-time.

## Intent
* Attaching Additional Responsibilities to an Object Dynamically.
* An Alternate to Subclasses for extending Functionalities.
