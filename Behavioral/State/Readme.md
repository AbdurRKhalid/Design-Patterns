# Introduction
The State Design Pattern is of class _Behavioral_ and having subclass of _Object Behavioral_. The object appears to change its class as a result chainging the internal strucutre.

## Also Known As

## Movtivation
Let's say that we have an implementation of the TCP Class, and the Object of TCP Changes according to occuring changes. Now, in order to handle this sudden change, we have to create a class that is common to all underlying classes. Due to one class being common for others it becomes easy to change the class based on a certain scenario and situation. This is the main idea of the State Design Pattern.
